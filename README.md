# RESTler Report Parser

## How to use

### From source code

Put the items in `bug_buckets` generated by RESTler parser directly into `src/assets/bug_buckets` folder in this project. Making the two folder idendical.

Then, build a static html report:

```
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

You will find an `index.html` in folder `dist`. It can be served by pnpm on port `4321`.

```
pnpm preview
```

### From docker file

1. Mount the folder inlcude bug buckets files to `/app/src/assets/bug_buckets`.

2. Mount the folder you want to place the output report to `/app/dist`

3. Run the docker container and the static HTML report will be generated.

├── bug_buckets/
│   ├── bug_buckets.json
│   ├── InvalidValueChecker_500_1.json
│   └── InvalidValueChecker_500_2.json
└── parser_output/
```

`compose.yaml`

```yaml
name: restler-report-parser
services:
  restler-report-parser:
    image: yukicoder/restler-report-parser:latest
    volumes:
      - "./bug_buckets:/app/src/assets/bug_buckets"
      - "./parser_output:/app/dist"
